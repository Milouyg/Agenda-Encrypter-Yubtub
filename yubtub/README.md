# Yubtub

## What do you read in this file?
In this file you will read about my final assignment of 
period 1.4 of Deep Dive Back-end. In this period we also have
a subject that includes Front-end and that is what you will read 
in this file. 

## Final assignment
In this final assignment we had to make Yubtub, a clone of Youtube but than better ;P.
The assignment contains 1 main video and 5 (or more) next videos in the aside.
When the video is ended on the main video, it will automatically go to the next video in the
aside. You can click on the star to supposedly add it in your favourites.
Also you can click on the arrow to go to the next video or click on a video in the aside
to go to another video that you like. The last thing you can do is add comments.
